In the park, there is a bench with a roof called Azumaya in Japanese. 
The last thing I remember from yesterday night was that me and my classmates had a drink here. 
Fabian introduced us a cocktail of Umeshu and Jasmin-tea and it was good.
We split in 23:30 and that is the last thing I remember. 

There was no sign of namecard or Airpods.
