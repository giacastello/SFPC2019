I am not sure if she knows about the concept
of the magic circle
but she does not seem to care.
Not about the circle nor about achiving
a certain beauty in others eyes.
How she shreds the harp
means
either she is a punk
or a ruthless
businesswoman.
But she does not care
and
made us sit in the park
wondering about life.
suddenly 梅酒 tasted
bittersweet and the light of the
lamp shone dreamy.
