I'm moving in some way. Maybe biking down Scripps, past M's house with the Sold sign in the front yard, or close enough to the river to smell it. The wind is brushing my face and into my ears. I turn left on Ashland and make my way to Korte where I cross over the door bridge. I'm making my way toward the dogwoods, hoping they still smell good like they did that night 3 weeks ago when I moved with S toward the water.
Maybe I'm playing soccer, with only 10 feet of foresight and half a plan. I'm not alone when playing soccer, in theory, but there are segments of alone-time (running toward the ball, deciding how I'll move to get there, chest burning). Moving to continue.
