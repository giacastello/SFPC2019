here you are, noticing. do you go further up? do you go down? 

more importantly, who are you climbing with? is this idea of a mountain in solitude, away from other people? why is that? why are you on a mountain? why not in the plains, in the valley, in a home, near a hearth, cooking with others? why not full of laughter? why not a space on flat, stable ground, where everyone can sit together? 

do you keep on going up? up there is a narrow point. up there is a peak, a top, a limit. down there is the ground. but outside of this logic are spaces, ponds, valleys, lakes, deserts, forests. 

what do you notice? when do you stop? what did you expect when you got here? what will you notice now that you're here?
