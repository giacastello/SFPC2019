a few years ago I was on Hallasan, a volcanic mountain on a subtropical island in Korea, south of the peninsula. I was climbing in the wintertime. imagine snow-blown trees looking like coral reefs. snow everywhere, blindingly bright. my body surrounded by jackets and scarves and long underwear, trapping pockets of warm air so that I might carry my small human body up this large earthly mountain.

climbing, climbing, climbing.

on the top of the mountain, emerging from the snow, there was a large shack with dozens of people milling about. the shack sold instant ramen, specifically shin ramyun. it seemed to be the only thing the shack sold: every person you saw was eating out of a bowl, steam billowing up and covering their faces in sweating steaming vapor. dozens of glasses fogging, foreheads beading. 

so we got a bowl. I started to eat. and for a moment, there is focus. there is the mountain, the snow, the trail, people, ramyun, and me. and the ramyun is perfect. it is hot, brothy, spicy, salty, savory, filling. the noodles are juicy, springy, full, filling. it is perfect. i lose myself in the steam and my sweat and the cold crisp air and I am just a pair of lips and tongue and mouth and eyes and nose and stomach, drinking and tasting and savoring.  I have had shin ramyun many, many times in my life, but this one is so different. it is one of the best meals I can remember.

I have thought about that bowl of instant ramyun many times since. this is not a story about a reward after hard work. the bowl of ramen was so delicious because I had decided that it was delicious. I remembered it because I wanted to remember. I savored it because I wanted to savor.  I have since had shin ramyun, and it was okay. I knew that, of course. The meal is something I created, not something I tasted. we create most things ourselves, because we are our worlds.

like the instant ramyun, this is a mediocre story if you want it to be, and a very meaningful story if you want it to be.
