Hello! and welcome to somewhere.

You are standing at the precipice of what a small hand-letterd sign says is "zzzl?", a baffling structure that..is frankly hard to describe. A mini semi - sagrada familia, something like a squat mixed with a castle mixed with a fort. Ok, but what do you actually see?

There is a castle's turret, tall and imposing, a ladder of rope-like...what...hair? alpaca hair? descends from on-high. A window far overhead. 

Adjacent to the turret is a small blanket fort. Some faint neo-nu-classical music can be vaguely heard, potentially a triumphal march from before the reckoning era? 

And off in a clump of thick trees is a descending rope ladder. Not more than 20 feet up the ladder is a rickety fort.

A bottle of fizzy-lifting-drink sits on the ground.
