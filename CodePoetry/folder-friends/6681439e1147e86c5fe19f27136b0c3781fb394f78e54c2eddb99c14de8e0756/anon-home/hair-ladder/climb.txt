A somewhat bizarre thick ladder made of what appears to be llama or yak or some animal's hair.

You grab the surprisingly thick and comforting rungs of the hair-ladder "...guided along as it were a chain of flowers into the mysteries of life." 

You haul your body up and up and up, your hand grabs the stone railing and you heave over and into the chamber.

"Helloo" says a booming voice connected to the hair ladder, for you have been climbing his lloonngg beard.

"I am Tam, a dromad merchant." 

"Here are all the dreams collected for you."

None of these shall harm you. You may enjoy as many or as little as you like.
